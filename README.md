# PorkNife
A fun first-person 3D raycasting-based Maze-solving RPG for ICS4U1

Epic Doom-style 3D Maze solving 

Thanks to `sheeptheelectric` for the original raycasting engine and images! I can't find a github repo for the original engine, but I started with this: [Making a Basic 3D Engine in Java](https://www.instructables.com/Making-a-Basic-3D-Engine-in-Java/).

## What's Been Done:
- Random Map Generation
- MiniMap Creation
- Start and End Positions
- Added a Hint
